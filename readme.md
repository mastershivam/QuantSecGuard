# QuantSecGuard

**QuantSecGuard** is an ML-powered anomaly detection system for financial time series â€” built at the intersection of quantitative finance, cybersecurity, and machine learning.

## Overview

This project applies unsupervised learning to detect unusual behavior in market data, simulating real-world use cases like:

- Market manipulation monitoring (e.g., spoofing, pump-and-dump)
- Strategy debugging (e.g., signal decay, execution drift)
- Risk anomaly detection

## Techniques Used

- **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection
- Feature engineering (returns, volatility, volume)
- Parameter tuning via F1-score with synthetic anomaly injection
- Real-time data ingestion using `yfinance` (stocks)
